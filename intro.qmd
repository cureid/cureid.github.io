## Welcome

This site is designed to provide guidance, scripts and resources for sites transitioning data to OMOP common data model as part of CURE ID.

CURE ID is a platform designed and developed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Translational Sciences (NCATS) to capture real world data (RWD) about how existing drugs are used in new ways (e.g., drug repurposing) to treat diseases of high unmet clinical need. The documentation on this site is part of a project funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)'s Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (under Interagency Agreement #75F40121S35006) to develop and disseminate tools facilitating the extraction of RWD from the electronic health record (EHR).

## Introduction

The goals of OMOP are to gain better understanding of human health by improving our ability to analyze observational health data.

Health data is stored by individual health systems in unique ways which limits the ability to collaborate and learn from larger populations. This is a problem because certain clinical conditions are infrequent and it is important to have sufficient number of cases to perform statistical tests. De-identified data shared across institutions has the promise of allowing scientists to develop important insights about health which is the motivation to enable greater collaboration.

#### What is a common data model?

A common data model (CDM) allows multiple health care systems with their individual databases to join forces creating greater populations which can power more compelling scientific studies. A simple way to think about this is the difficulty of finding the silverware drawer in a new kitchen -- if there is a unifying rule for where the silverware drawer is located in every kitchen (immediately to right of the sink) it makes it possible to find this much easier. A common data model creates a system so that data elements like "systolic blood pressure" or "sepsis" are recorded and organized in the same way. OMOP stands for Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and is the common data model of the [Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics](https://www.ohdsi.org/) program.

#### What is an ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. Essentially this is the process of mapping data from one system to another. Please see \[The Book of OHDSI, Chapter 6\] (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/ExtractTransformLoad.html).

## Getting started

The code for the CURE ID project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to host, review, and collaborate on code repositories. It is widely used for version control and source code management, and it provides features such as issue tracking, wikis, and project management tools to facilitate team collaboration.Â 

The repository containing the code and concept sets can be accessed at [OHDSI/CureIdRegistry](https://github.com/OHDSI/CureIdRegistry) There are four branches within the repository that differ only in the clinical variables included in the cohort curation scripts. Be sure to select the appropriate branch based on individual health system data and ETL capacity:

1.  Main branch: fundamental set of variables for Registry submission - demographics, comorbidities, vitals, labs, medications, vaccinations, oxygen devices, viral assays, and COVID complications.
2.  Refresh Basic: the main branch variables with additional concepts to allow for Charlson Comorbidity Index calculation
3.  Refresh Advanced: the refresh basic branch variables with additional concepts for Area Deprivation Index calculation (this branch requires Geocoding patient addresses to determine Census Blocks)
4.  Main CDM v5.3: this is the same set of variables included in the main branch but with cohort curation scripts written for the OMOP CDM version 5.3 (there are four fields names that changed from version 5.3 to 5.4)

## CURE ID technical support checklist

1.  Core site team identified and technical kickoff call scheduled
2.  Determine feasibility of using [Edge Tool Suite](https://github.com/OHDSI/CureIdRegistry/blob/main/EdgeToolSuite.md)
3.  If using Edge Tool Suite is not possible, has the site determined a path forward, for example using Spectrum Health Scripts?
4.  Members of core team send proof of course completion to Danielle Boyce for the following free EHDEN academy courses:
    -   [Course: OMOP CDM and Standardised Vocabularies (ehden.eu)](https://academy.ehden.eu/course/view.php?id=4)
    -   [Course: Extract, Transform and Load (ehden.eu)](https://academy.ehden.eu/course/view.php?id=7)
5.  Site Completes CURE ID Manual OMOP Data Mapping Template
6.  JHU reviews steps for performing ETL process by walking through GitHub scripts
7.  Meetings with JHU software contractors arranged, if needed
8.  Site confirms that they are using most recent GitHub scripts before proceeding
9.  Data Quality Dashboard Run
10. JSON and script output sent to Danielle Boyce
11. DQD and concept counts approved or issues identified and reviewed with technical team
12. DQD and concept counts re-run and approved by JHU technical team
13. Run CURE ID scripts (see OMOP Cohort Creation and De-identification Guide)
14. De-identified data exported to CSV file
15. JHU/C-Path technical team reviews CSV files before transfer
16. Any caveats in the data documented in Data Export Cover Sheet
17. Data transfer arrangements made by contacting Smitty Heavner
