## OMOP Table and Field Basics

Adapted from OHDSI CDM Site: [Data Model Conventions](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/dataModelConventions.html) 

#### Tables

For the tables of the main domains of the CDM it is imperative that concepts used are strictly limited to the domain. For example, the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table contains only information about conditions (diagnoses, signs, symptoms), but no information about procedures. Not all source coding schemes adhere to such rules. For example, ICD-9-CM codes, which contain mostly diagnoses of human disease, also contain information about the status of patients having received a procedure. The ICD-9-CM code V20.3 'Newborn health supervision' defines a continuous procedure and is therefore stored in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table.

#### Fields

Variable names across all tables follow one convention:

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Notation**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| \_SOURCE_VALUE      | Verbatim information from the source data, typically used in ETL to map to CONCEPT_ID, and not to be used by any standard analytics. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE = '787.02' was the ICD-9 code captured as a diagnosis from the administrative claim.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| \_ID                | Unique identifiers for key entities, which can serve as foreign keys to establish relationships across entities. For example, PERSON_ID uniquely identifies each individual. VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID uniquely identifies a PERSON encounter at a point of care.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \_CONCEPT_ID        | Foreign key into the Standardized Vocabularies (i.e. the standard_concept attribute for the corresponding term is true), which serves as the primary basis for all standardized analytics. For example, CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID = [31967](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/31967) contains the reference value for the SNOMED concept of 'Nausea'                                                                                          |
| \_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID | Foreign key into the Standardized Vocabularies representing the concept and terminology used in the source data, when applicable. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID = [45431665](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45431665) denotes the concept of 'Nausea' in the Read terminology; the analogous CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID might be 31967, since SNOMED-CT is the Standardized Vocabulary for most clinical diagnoses and findings. |
| \_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID   | Delineates the origin of the source information, standardized within the Standardized Vocabularies. For example, DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can allow analysts to discriminate between 'Pharmacy dispensing' and 'Prescription written                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Cure ID Concept Mapping Support

![](images/CureID_Concept_Mapping_Process.png)

#### Collaborative OMOP Concept Mapping Process

1.  CureID clinical informaticists work with each site to manually map internal concepts to OMOP concepts outlined for capture in the project plan.

2.  The combined concepts from all sites are maintained as a single, updated concept set using the OHDSI ATLAS open-source tool.

3.  All concepts currently identified by the work between CureID staff and each site, and all corresponding descendant concepts are exported from ATLAS as .json or .csv files for use in cohort creation, profiling, and clinical registry submission.

# Geocoding and Integrating SDOH Data  
To link geocoded addresses to the Neighborhood Atlas for getting the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) for patients in a dataset, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Dataset
Patient Data: Ensure you have a dataset of patients with addresses. This data should be anonymized to protect patient privacy.
Geocoding: Each address needs to be geocoded. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
2. Geocoding Addresses
Use a Geocoding Service: Tools like Google Maps API, ArcGIS, or OpenStreetMap can be used to geocode addresses. This will give you the precise geographic location for each address.
Accuracy Check: Ensure the geocoding is accurate. Incorrect geocoding can lead to wrong ADI assignments.
3. Understanding the Neighborhood Atlas
ADI Overview: The ADI is a measure developed by the Neighborhood Atlas. It provides a ranked and searchable list of neighborhoods according to their level of disadvantage.
Data Format: Understand the format of the Neighborhood Atlas data. It typically includes geographical identifiers like census tracts.
4. Linking Geocoded Data to the Neighborhood Atlas
Match Coordinates with Census Tracts: Use the geographic coordinates to determine the corresponding census tract for each patient. This can be done using GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS.
Cross-Reference with ADI Data: Once you have the census tract for each patient, cross-reference these with the Neighborhood Atlas to find the ADI for each tract.
5. Integrating ADI into Your Dataset
Add ADI to Patient Records: For each patient, add the ADI corresponding to their census tract. This step integrates socioeconomic context into your patient data.

### Geocoding

The primary consideration for linking geospatial data like social determinants of health and environmental risk factors with patient data is protecting PHI when geocoding patient home address and location data. Do not use web-based API services for geocoding as they require patient addresses to be sent to an external server for batch geocoding.
Geocoding will require software that can match patient addresses to the appropriate shapefiles to determine a precise location and output latitudinal/longitudinal coordinates. Two software solutions for geocoding include:
- Use ESRI ArcGIS or a similar program that can perform geocoding locally and has all appropriate shapefiles downloaded. This software is expensive, but many institutions have a license already in place.
- Install geocoding software (ex: open-source, Degauss geocoder: https://www.degauss.org/geocoder) locally via manual installation or by installing a docker container.

### Area Deprivation Index

The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is based on a measure created by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) over three decades ago, and has since been refined, adapted, and validated to the Census block group neighborhood level by Amy Kind, MD, PhD and her research team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It allows for rankings of neighborhoods by socioeconomic disadvantage in a region of interest (e.g., at the state or national level). It includes factors for the theoretical domains of income, education, employment, and housing quality. It can be used to inform health delivery and policy, especially for the most disadvantaged neighborhood groups. "Neighborhood" is defined as a Census block group.

### ADI as an OHDSI Concept

ADI is not included as an explicit concept in any of the appropriate standard vocabularies. The OHDSI Vocabularies Team recommended that this information be included in the OMOP data as a custom concept in the Observation table. The workflow will be simply to add a line item to the concept mapping table for Area Deprivation Index like the following example:
concept_id = 2000000999
concept_code = NA
concept_name = Area deprivation index
domain = observation
vocabulary = Custom
is_standard = C
include_descendents = False


# OHDSI Tool Suite

The Edge Tool Suite are a set of OHDSI tools that should be deployed by the site that provide value around the OMOP CDM. This work was funded by the CURE ID initiative <https://cure.ncats.io>

The OHDSI open source software configured for deployment include:

-   The Atlas data science platform

-   The WebAPI backed for Atlas

-   The HADES statistical analysis packages

-   The Data Quality Dashboard

-   The Perseus ETL management system

#### Simplifying the ETL process

The OHDSI community has created a series of individual software packages to facilitate the ETL from proprietary EHRs to OMOP, evaluate data quality, define cohorts, and perform analyses. The "Edge Tool" packages these individual tools to facilitate the performance of an OMOP ETL and subsequent use of the data for defining cohorts for observational research. In contrast to registry approaches which ingest data represented in various data models and perform data harmonization centrally, software components of the "Edge Tool" facilitate ETL performance locally at the "edge." This suite of software aims to drastically reduce the labor and effort required to go from "zero to OMOP." We anticipate that institutions that use the full suite of offered software will be able to reduce the person-hours required for an OMOP ETL to as little as 50 hours.

#### Software components

The Edge Tool encompasses the Perseus ETL management solution, the HADES R analysis package within an RStudio Server R integrated development environment, and the ATLAS cohort discovery tool with WebAPI web services integration (Figure). The Perseus graphic-user interface (GUI) approach provides source-to-concept mapping for the ETL, with assisted extraction of data from EHR such as flowsheets (vital signs, nursing assessments), test measurements, and diagnoses. Rather than performing a series of SQL queries with wildcards to identify data elements of interest from primary source EHR tables,users may enter desired data element terms into a browser text field which are then matched using term similarity to source table entries.Users may then evaluate the completeness and quality of the ETL using the Data Quality Dashboard which performs \>3,000 individual data quality checks on the OMOP-formatted data and is reported through a web-based reporting system.

In tandem with Perseus, OHDSI HADES and OHDSI ATLAS are the two projects within the Edge Tool that allow for advanced analysis once data has been harmonized with the OMOP CDM, such as generating cohorts for research, patient level prediction, treatment pathways, large scale population analytics, automated reporting and, optionally, participation in OHDSI network studies.The OHDSI applications within the Edge Tool have been containerized using OHDSI Broadsea, allowing for even easier deployment. Current use of the Edge Tool has proven promising and while limitations still exist - e.g., not currently capable of extracting data from unstructured fields such as notes or loose text - further process optimization and tool development will reduce this implementation time and effort further.

# Best Practices

Data Quality Dos and Don'ts

-   Do install the Data Quality Dashboard early on in the process.

-   Don't include source values in your export - they might include PHI.

-   Don't forget to check GitHub for the most recent version of the script before you run it.

-   Don't send your data to the coordinating center until the tech team has a chance to review it with you in a live session.

-   Duplicated results have been reported at some sites when running script 02_CURE_ID_ALL_Tables.sql. However, at this time no root cause has been found. There is some belief that adding DISTINCT to the various SELECT statements could resolve the issue, while there is some concern over the latest updates to script 00_CURE_ID_create_concept_table.sql as it has standard concepts as well as standard descendants. Be sure to review your data carefully and report any signs of duplication so that it can be investigated.
